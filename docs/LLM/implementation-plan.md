# LLM Dialect Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the LLM dialect in MLIR. The dialect is designed to provide optimized operations and types for large language model inference.

## Current Implementation

The initial implementation of the LLM dialect includes:

1. **Core dialect infrastructure**:
   - Basic dialect registration
   - Type definitions and implementations
   - Operation definitions and implementations

2. **Custom Types**:
   - `PagedKVCache`: For efficient memory management of attention key-value pairs
   - `ShardedTensor`: For tensor parallelism across devices
   - `QuantizedTensor`: For representing quantized tensors with metadata

3. **Core Operations**:
   - Attention operations: `attention` and `paged_attention`
   - KV cache management: `append_kv` and `lookup_kv`
   - Quantization operations: `quantize`, `dequantize`, and `quantized_matmul`
   - Parallel computation: `sharded_linear`, `all_gather`, and `reduce_scatter`

4. **Examples**:
   - Basic examples showing the use of the LLM dialect operations

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The next phase of implementation will focus on:

1. **Runtime Support**:
   - Implement runtime-specific utilities for KV cache management
   - Develop GPU kernels for `paged_attention` and other operations
   - Integrate with existing MLIR GPU lowering infrastructure

2. **Transformation Passes**:
   - Implement canonicalization patterns for LLM operations
   - Develop optimization passes for LLM inference (e.g., operator fusion)
   - Add memory planning passes for efficient KV cache allocation

3. **Lowering Patterns**:
   - Create conversion patterns to lower LLM operations to existing dialects
   - Implement specialized lowering paths for different hardware targets
   - Add support for lowering to CUDA/ROCm for GPU execution

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Develop unit tests for all operations and types
   - Create end-to-end integration tests
   - Set up benchmarking for performance evaluation

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

Longer-term enhancements for the dialect:

1. **Advanced Attention Mechanisms**:
   - Implement sliding window attention
   - Add support for multi-query attention 
   - Integrate sparse attention patterns (e.g., block-sparse)
   - Implement FlashAttention-2 optimizations

2. **Quantization Enhancements**:
   - Support for more quantization formats (e.g., NF4, 2-bit)
   - Dynamic quantization modes for activations
   - Mixed-precision operations for balancing performance and accuracy

3. **Advanced Parallelism**:
   - Support for pipeline parallelism
   - Sequence parallelism (e.g., sequence splitting)
   - Expert parallelism for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models

4. **Model Structure Optimizations**:
   - Sparsity exploitation at different levels
   - Pruning-aware operation execution
   - Activation checkpoint optimization

5. **Integration with Frameworks**:
   - Export/import bridges to popular LLM frameworks
   - Integration with serving platforms
   - Specialized runtime for MLIR-compiled LLM models

## Implementation Priorities

The implementation will focus on the following priorities:

1. **Correctness**: Ensure operations correctly implement the intended behavior
2. **Performance**: Optimize for high throughput and low latency during inference
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory usage for large model deployments
4. **Usability**: Provide clear interfaces and documentation for using the dialect
5. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancements and hardware targets

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core dialect infrastructure, types, and operations
- **Phase 2** (Current): Runtime support, transformation passes, lowering patterns, testing
- **Phase 3** (Future): Advanced operations, optimizations, and integrations
